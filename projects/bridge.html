			<bold>Pedestrian Bridge</bold><br/><br/>
			2007<br/>
			Cor-10 steel, LED lighting<br/>
			Â½ mile long, 132 ft. tall at highest point<br/><br/>

			Back in 2007, Matt was working for RDG Planning and Design, an architecture and planning firm in Des Moines, Iowa. After a string of research and fabrication assignments, Matt worked with David Dahlquist, public artist and partner at RDG, to design this pedestrian bridge near Woodward, Iowa.<br/><br/>
			 
			The bridge creates an unexpected experience in a landscape often overlooked by Central Iowans. At high speeds on a bicycle, its gates feel as if they are rotating. The effect encourages cyclists to slow down, or even to stop at one of several lookout points. When standing still on the bridge, its strong perspectival view disintegrates. The experience of the passage turns outward, to the expansive landscape on all sides.<br/><br/>
