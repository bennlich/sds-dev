			<bold>CCA Design MFA Thesis Exhibition</bold><br/><br/>
			2014<br/>
			<a href="http://ccamfadesign14.com/">Follow to Exhibition Website ------></a><br/><br/>
			The CCA Graduate Design department is transdisciplinary. This means that all graduate design students, regardless of professional focus, produce work that overlaps the three major design disciplines: graphic, interaction, and industrial. Accordingly, the CCA MFA Design exhibition for 2014 seeks to emphasize each studentâ€™s unique engagement with a broad spectrum of design media, ideas, and intentions.<br/><br/>

			As a way to organize the show, each student was asked to measure the influence of the three disciplines on his or her thesis work. By quantifying these relationships and using them as axes, a triangular logo with a unique color was generated for every project. The shape and color of each logo positioned each project in a specific gallery space, and revealed unexpected affinities between thesis investigations.  Matt and Chris were responsible for triangular logo system, curating the spaces, and coordinating the design and construction of the structures.<br/><br/>
