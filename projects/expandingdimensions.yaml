  In 2015, we were approached by the CCA Faculty Exhibition’s curator Mara Holt-Skov to design the exhibition identity 
  for the CCA's Faculty Exhibition.  <br/><br/>

  <i>"Expanding Dimensions includes projects from CCAfaculty members working across the college 
  in a variety of disciplines and media to express their ideas and pursue their passions. 
  Their work takes many different forms and explores multiple dimensions—1D TEXT, 2D GRAPHIC, 
  3D OBJECT AND SPACE, and 4D TIME—all the while reaching into the invisible, intangible 5D 
  space of EMOTION where art, architecture, craft, design and writing are capable of making the 
  most meaningful connections with audiences."</i><br/>
  -Mara Holt-Skov, Curator<br/><br/>
  To address the pan-dimensional theme, we began our investigation with formal explorations with 
  the grid: a structure which contains little content itself, but conveys information in its organization, 
  variation, and deformities.  From our explorations of structure, we developed a rule-based layout 
  system which could change its arrangement and imagery with each implementation.  The graphic system 
  contained guidelines for typographic layout, icons, image masks of the sky, and grid warping which 
  allowed each instance of the identity to take on new organization and color.  To take advantage of the 
  flexible structure, we produced 100 unique posters, exhibition signage, animated title wall, email 
  announcements, and wall labels.
