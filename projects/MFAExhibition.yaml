  The CCA Graduate Design department is transdisciplinary. This means that all 
  graduate design students, regardless of professional focus, produce work that 
  overlaps the three major design disciplines: graphic, interaction, and industrial. 
  Accordingly, the CCA MFA Design exhibition for 2014 seeks to emphasize each 
  studentâ€™s unique engagement with a broad spectrum of design media, ideas, and intentions.<br/><br/>

  As a way to organize the show, each student was asked to measure the influence 
  of the three disciplines on his or her thesis work. By quantifying these 
  relationships and using them as axes, a triangular logo with a unique color was 
  generated for every project. The shape and color of each logo positioned each project 
  in a specific gallery space, and revealed unexpected affinities between thesis 
  investigations.  Matt and Chris were responsible for triangular logo system, curating 
  the spaces, and coordinating the design and construction of the structures.<br/>
