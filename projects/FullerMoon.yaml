  Enjoy the warm celestial glow of a Fuller Moon. Building on the experiments of visionary Buckminster Fuller, we designed a pendant lamp that features 
  lightweight acrylic panels with a satin finish, and an ultra-efficient LED bulb. Translucent 3D-printed connectors highlight a Fuller Moon’s ideal geometry.<br/><br/> 

  Fuller Moon is simultaneously poetic, mathematical, and utilitarian.  Its faces evenly distribute light without direct glare, the dimmable LED bulb is rated 
  to last 50,000 hours, soothing warm temperature light reduces the sleep disrupting effect of blue wavelengths, and self-stabilizing geometry allows for little 
  material to enclose a large volume.<br/><br/>

  Bucky’s development of the field of Synergetics drove his optimistic vision for a sustainable future for mankind through efficiency.  Almost 33 years since 
  his death in 1983, SDS has learned that it’s not just efficiency that leads to survival, it’s livability too.  By merging poetry, functionality, and economic 
  material usage, SDS wants to encourage people to adopt products that are better for spaceship earth.<br/><br/>
